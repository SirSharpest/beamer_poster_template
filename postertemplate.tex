    \begin{block}{Introduction}

      This project aims to create a set of data, of novel phenotypic information, using a computer vision technique I developed 
      at the National Plant Phenomics Centre for examining wheat grains using $\mu$-Computed Tomography \cite{Hughes2017}. This technique
      allows for a detailed extraction of 3-dimensional morphometric data of seeds in wheat and other crops.

      \vspace{1cm}
      
      I have been able to gain access to a wide range or primitive, non-domesticated wheat varieties
      as well as their cultivated relatives. These genotypes also provide a nice gradient of ploidy
      which could also provide great insight into how genome structure effects grains. I aim to use
      the outlinned method to extract data from these crops and create statistical analysis software
      to answer various research questions.
      
    \end{block}

    \begin{block}{Research Aims}
      Primarily I have three main null-hypothesis which I hope this project will be able to reject:

      \begin{itemize}
      \item{$H_0=$ Domestication has no effect on the morphometric properties of wheat}
      \item{$H_0=$ Ploidy has no effect on the morphometric properties of wheat}
      \item{$H_0=$ There is no difference in hulled and non-hulled genotypes}
      \end{itemize}
      
    \end{block}

    \begin{block}{Grain Parameters}

      The technique being used to produce these data provides a number of attributes for me to use in
      analysis. The primary ones can be seen in the figure \ref{fig:real}

      \begin{multicols}{2}

        \begin{figure}[htb]
          \centering
          \includegraphics[width=8cm]{collection2.png}
          \caption{\label{fig:real} wheat grains labelled with data}
        \end{figure}

        \columnbreak

        \begin{figure}[htb]
          \centering
          \includegraphics[width=11.5cm]{collection.png}
          \caption{\label{fig:3d} wheat Spikes original (left) and scanned (right)}
        \end{figure}        
        
      \end{multicols}
      
    \end{block}

    \begin{block}{Software Development Aims}
      In order to make this work reproducible, as I believe it will justify many further studies
      I am creating a software library which acts as a specialist tool for handling the type of data
      which CT-Scanners output.

      To do this I am using the \textit{PyQT} library to create a GUI framework which will be useable
      by non-programmers in order to test hypothesis and build systematic models of the given input
      data. 
    \end{block}

    \begin{block}{Future Work}

      My main aims for the future is to fully implement my statistical library, once completed I can
      focus on testing my outlined hypothesis. I will also be aiming to make use of the \textit{scipy}
      data models packages in Python in order to better model the data and to search for more vital
      underlying meanings in the data I've created.

      \vspace{0.5cm}

      Once this library is more complete, I shall be joining it into the GUI I have developed
      to allow for quick, easy and automatic analysis of future experiments. Should this
      project justify the need for more information, then it should be easily added through
      this additional application that I am developing with \textit{PyQt}. 

      \vspace{0.5cm}
      In order to address a broader picture, and to widen the scope of this research I am in the process of
      obtaining data used by Gegas et.al in 2011 to examine 2-Dimensional morphometric traits for a wide array of
      wheat that correlates nicely with what I have produced so far \cite{gegas}.
      \\
      This would hopefully provide a lot of interesting information if the datasets were to compliment each other.

    \begin{block}{Current Progress}

      My work to date has been primarily focused on modifying
      and adapting my 3D analysis software to fit the required
      parameters to work with such a varied data source.

      \vspace{0.5cm}

      Additionally I have been building a data processing library whichs aims to:
      \begin{multicols}{2}
        
        \begin{itemize}
        \item simplify data input
        \item perform data cleaning
        \item automatically generates plots
        \end{itemize}

        \columnbreak

        \begin{itemize}
        \item handles data from multiple sources
        \item adding additional experiment parameters
        \end{itemize}

      \end{multicols}

      \vspace{0.5cm}

      Figure \ref{fig:initalboxplots} shows one example of the auto analysis which my library
      can perform in its early stages of development.
      
      \begin{figure}[htb]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=22cm]{domesticated.png}
        \caption{\label{fig:initalboxplots}Initial Data analysis of Domestication and Ploidy}
      \end{figure}
      
    \end{block}

    
    \begin{block}{Statistical Methods and Testing}

      In order to answer these questions a number of statistical tests will be required,
      as will numerous elements of data science. I am planning to use:

      \begin{multicols}{2}

        \begin{itemize}
        \item ANOVA
        \item MANOVA
        \item $\chi^2$ Tests
        \end{itemize}

        \columnbreak

        \begin{itemize}
        \item PCA
        \item GLMs
        \item T/F-Tests
        \end{itemize}

      \end{multicols}

      From the data in Figure:\ref{fig:initalboxplots} you can see that the data is
      messy before processing. I have used QQ-Plots in Figure:\ref{fig:qq} to illustrate
      the non-parametric nature of the data. This is a problem I hope to solve in the future.
        \begin{figure}[htb]
          \centering
          \includegraphics[width=22cm]{qqplots.png}
          \caption{\label{fig:qq} QQ-Plots showing Distribution}
        \end{figure}
